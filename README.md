### DFIR Threat Hunting Hub  

**DFIR Threat Hunting Hub** is a curated collection of high-quality resources, tools, and learning materials designed for cybersecurity students, digital forensics professionals, and threat hunters. This repository consolidates valuable references from across the security community to support hands-on learning and real-world investigations.  

It includes:  
- **Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges** and lab environments to enhance practical DFIR and threat hunting skills.  
- **GitHub repositories and community resources** relevant to incident response, memory forensics, and adversary detection.  
- **Free tools and utilities** for forensics analysis, network monitoring, endpoint detection, and threat emulation.  
- **Learning platforms and educational websites** covering DFIR methodologies, adversary techniques (MITRE ATT&CK), and blue team operations.  
- **E-books, documentation, and research material** for continuous professional development in cybersecurity.  

This repository aims to serve as a centralized knowledge base for mastering **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)** and advancing **Threat Hunting** expertise. It is regularly updated to ensure relevance, accuracy, and accessibility for learners and professionals alike.
